## Installing R and RStudio
  
In this problem set, we're going to get R, RStudio, and R Markdown set up on your computer. To get started, follow these steps: 

1. Download and install the most recent version of [R][]. There are versions available for the Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. On a Windows machine, you will want to install using the `R-x.y.z-win.exe` file where `x.y.z` is a version number. On a Mac, you will want to install using the `R-x.y.z.pkg` file that is notarized and signed. 

2. With R installed, download and install [RStudio][]. RStudio is a type of "integrated development environment" or IDE designed for R. It makes working with R considerably easier and is available for most platforms. It is also free. 

3. Install the packages we will use throughout the semester. To do this, either type or copy and paste each of the following lines of code into the "Console" in RStudio (lower left panel by default). Make sure you do this separately for each line. If you are asked if you want to install any packages from source, type "no". Note that the symbols next to `my_package` are a less than sign `<` followed by a minus sign `-` with no space between them. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_packages <- c("tidyverse", "usethis", "devtools", "learnr", "tinytex")
install.packages(my_packages, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
remotes::install_github("kosukeimai/qss-package", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

4. For some things in the course, we'll need produce PDFs from R and that requires something called LaTeX. If you've never heard of that, it's completely fine and you should just run the following two lines of R code:
  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()  # install TinyTeX
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
#plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter prevents printing the R code that generates the plot.

```{r}
#UNpop <- read.csv("UNpop.csv")
#summary(UNpop)
#plot(UNpop$year, UNpop$world.pop)
```

## Extra Credit

### Setup a GitHub account

Next, you can setup a [GitHub][] account. You can think of GitHub as similar to Dropbox or Google Drive for your git projects ("repositories") where everything is public by default. Since you might use this account to interact with potential employers in the future, you should pick a professional username (e.g., mine is `AJKnuppe`)
